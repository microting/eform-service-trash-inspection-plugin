/// <summary>
/// Unit tests for eFormCompletedHandler
/// 
/// The eFormCompletedHandler is the most complex handler responsible for:
/// 1. Looking up case data from the database
/// 2. Retrieving case information from the SDK core
/// 3. Parsing form fields to extract approval status and comments
/// 4. Updating database entities (TrashInspectionCase and TrashInspection) to status 100
/// 5. Setting inspection approval status, comment, and marking inspection as done
/// 6. Retracting all related cases
/// 7. Making external SOAP API calls to Navision Business Central 365 (with NTLM or Basic auth)
/// 
/// Expected behavior:
/// - When TrashInspectionCase doesn't exist: handler should do nothing
/// - When case exists: status should be updated to 100
/// - When inspection is approved (field value = "1"): IsApproved = true, ApprovedValue = "1"
/// - When inspection is not approved (field value != "1"): IsApproved = false
/// - Comment field ("Kommentar") should be extracted and saved
/// - InspectionDone should be set to true
/// - All related cases should be retracted (deleted from SDK and workflow state = Retracted)
/// - SOAP call should be made to callback URL with approval result
/// - Success/error messages from callback should be saved to database
/// 
/// Authentication types supported:
/// - NTLM: Uses Windows credentials with domain/username/password
/// - Basic: Uses basic HTTP authentication with username/password
/// </summary>
